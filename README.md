SignalTrace is a self-hosted tracking and analysis platform for honeypot deployment, link tracking, and security visibility. It logs every interaction with your custom paths, scores each request for bot/human likelihood, and feeds the results into your security tooling.

No external services required. One PHP app, one SQLite database, one Apache vhost.

---

## Why SignalTrace

Most tracking tools tell you *that* something hit an endpoint. SignalTrace tells you *what kind of thing* hit it, how confident the assessment is, and why — with enough detail to act on immediately or pipe into a SIEM.

Every hit gets a 0–100 human-likelihood score with named signal reasons. The built-in threat feed at `/feed/ips.txt` is ready to consume from a firewall or block list. The JSON and CSV export endpoints support token-based authentication for scheduled Splunk ingestion.

Good for: phishing simulations, honeypot deployments, recon detection, link tracking, and threat feed generation.

## Requirements

SignalTrace is designed to run on minimal hardware. A 1 vCPU VM with 1 GB RAM and swap enabled is sufficient. Plan for 5–10 GB of disk depending on how much traffic you log.

Software requirements: PHP 8.1+, SQLite3, Apache with mod_rewrite, Composer.

---

## Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to get SignalTrace running is with Docker Compose.

### 1. Clone and run the setup script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veddegre/signaltrace.git
cd signaltrace
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will ask whether you are doing a Docker or manual install, then walk through all configuration options. For Docker it generates `.env`. For a manual install it writes `includes/config.local.php` directly.

It will prompt for your admin username, password, host port (Docker only), MaxMind credentials, export API token, and reverse proxy IP. All optional values can be left blank.

If PHP is not installed on the host and you chose Docker, the script will build the container first and generate the bcrypt password hash from inside it automatically.

### 2. Start the container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

SignalTrace will be available at `http://localhost:PORT/admin` where PORT is the port you selected during setup. On first start the database is initialised automatically. If MaxMind credentials are set, GeoIP databases are downloaded as well.

### 3. Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The SQLite database and GeoIP databases are stored in named Docker volumes and persist across rebuilds.

### Notes

The Docker image is based on Ubuntu 24.04. The MaxMind PPA is used to install `geoipupdate`. The Apache config includes the `Authorization` header fix required for Bearer token auth — you don't need to add anything manually if you're using Docker.

On Proxmox LXC containers, the `security_opt: apparmor=unconfined` setting in `docker-compose.yml` is required for the container runtime to function correctly.

---

## Manual Installation (Ubuntu + Apache)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
cd /var/www
sudo git clone https://github.com/veddegre/signaltrace.git
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data signaltrace
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2 php php-sqlite3 php-mbstring php-xml php-curl sqlite3 composer unzip software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maxmind/ppa
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y geoipupdate
```

### 3. Install PHP dependencies

```bash
cd /var/www/signaltrace
sudo -u www-data composer install --no-dev
```

### 4. Create the data directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/signaltrace/data
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/signaltrace/data
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/signaltrace/data
```

### 5. Run the setup script

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

Select option 2 (Manual) when prompted. The script will walk through all configuration options and then automatically:

- Write `includes/config.local.php`
- Configure `/etc/GeoIP.conf` and run `geoipupdate` to download the MaxMind databases (if credentials were provided)
- Initialise the SQLite database, with an option to load sample data
- Set correct `www-data` ownership on all files

After the script completes the only remaining steps are configuring Apache and restarting it.

---

## Configuration Tuning

The setup script prompts for all configuration including optional tuning values — auth lockout threshold and duration, self-referrer domain penalty, reverse proxy IP, and export API token. You don't need to edit any files manually after running it.

If you need to change a value after the initial setup, edit `includes/config.local.php` directly (manual install) or update `.env` and restart the container (Docker). The available settings and their defaults are documented in `includes/config.local.php.example`.

---

## Apache Configuration

```bash
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/signaltrace.conf
```

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.example
    DocumentRoot /var/www/signaltrace/public

    # Pass the Authorization header through to PHP.
    # Required for Bearer token authentication on the export and feed endpoints.
    SetEnvIf Authorization "^(.*)$" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1

    <Directory /var/www/signaltrace/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog  ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/signaltrace_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/signaltrace_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2ensite signaltrace.conf
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Place this in `public/.htaccess`:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^\.well-known/acme-challenge/ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
```

---

## HTTPS

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

---

## Admin

```text
https://yourdomain.example/admin
```

---

## Threat Feed

The threat feed is available at `/feed/ips.txt` and requires admin authentication. It outputs a deduplicated list of IPs classified at or above your configured confidence threshold, suitable for consumption by firewalls, block lists, SIEM enrichment pipelines, or temporary deny lists.

Behaviour is configured in the Settings tab: time window, minimum confidence threshold. Individual tokens and ASN rules can each be flagged to suppress their hits from feed output, so you never accidentally block infrastructure you own.

---

## SIEM and Splunk Integration

Set an export API token in `.env` (Docker) or `config.local.php` (manual install):

```bash
# Generate with
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Apache strips the `Authorization` header before it reaches PHP by default. Verify your vhost config includes this line — without it, Bearer token auth will silently fail:

```apache
SetEnvIf Authorization "^(.*)$" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
```

Then poll either export endpoint on a schedule:

```text
https://yourdomain.example/export/json
https://yourdomain.example/export/csv
```

Authenticate with a header (recommended, not logged by Apache):

```text
Authorization: Bearer your-generated-token
```

Or with a query parameter if your tooling doesn't support custom headers (note this appears in access logs):

```text
https://yourdomain.example/export/csv?api_key=your-generated-token
```

When polled with no filters, the export applies the configured confidence threshold, minimum score, and time window from Settings. Pass `?ip=`, `?path=`, `?date_from=`, or other filter parameters to override.

### Splunk App

A ready-to-use Splunk integration is included under `splunk/signaltrace/`. Copy the folder into your Splunk `etc/apps/` directory and restart Splunk. Configure the scripted input in `bin/signaltrace_fetch.sh` with your SignalTrace URL and API token.

The app includes two Dashboard Studio dashboards:

**SignalTrace — Overview** (`dashboards/signaltrace_overview.json`) is designed for SOC screen display. It has no inputs and always shows the last 24 hours. Panels cover stat cards, events over time, confidence distribution, top IPs, traffic by country, top ASN organisations, top tokens, top bot tokens, top detection signals, and bot traffic by country.

**SignalTrace — Event Investigation** (`dashboards/signaltrace_events.json`) is designed for hands-on investigation. It has a time range picker, token/path text filter, IP filter, and classification dropdown. The table returns up to 200 results.

---

## Detection and Scoring

Each request is scored on arrival. The score runs from 0 (definitely a bot) to 100 (definitely human) and resolves to one of four labels: **bot**, **suspicious**, **likely-human**, or **human**. The bands are: human ≥75, likely-human ≥60, suspicious ≥25, bot <25.

Signals that reduce the score include missing Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, and Sec-Fetch headers; a browser UA with no supporting browser headers (spoofed UA detection); `Accept: */*` which is what HTTP libraries send by default; known automation UA signatures; raw IP in the Host header; exploit-like query strings; and hosting/datacenter IP ranges detected via ASN org name.

The Sec-Fetch and Sec-CH-UA checks are browser-aware. Safari is not penalised for headers it never sends. The Sec-CH-UA (Client Hints) penalty only applies when the UA claims to be Chromium-based.

Behavioral signals layer on top: rapid repeat requests, burst activity, and multi-token scanning all reduce the score in proportion to how aggressively the behavior is occurring.

Paths associated with common probes carry their own penalties. High-risk paths like `.env`, `_environment`, `.aws/credentials`, `.git`, and webshell patterns knock 40 points off. Medium-risk paths like `wp-admin`, `phpinfo`, `phpmyadmin`, Laravel debug tools, and Spring Boot actuator endpoints knock off 25.

ASN rules let you add manual score penalties for specific networks via the UI.

The `public/` directory is the only thing Apache needs to serve. Everything else — includes, data, db, vendor — lives outside the document root.

## Security

`config.local.php` is never committed and contains all secrets. Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes. All SQL uses parameterised queries. URL destinations are validated against an http/https allowlist at both write time and redirect time.

Admin login has rate limiting with a configurable lockout threshold and window. CSRF tokens protect all admin POST forms. Security response headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy) are sent on every HTML response. The webhook fires only to validated URLs and blocks private and loopback IP ranges to prevent SSRF. The export API token is compared in constant time.
